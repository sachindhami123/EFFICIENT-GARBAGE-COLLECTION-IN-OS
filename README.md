 Introduction
Garbage collection (GC) is a key process used in memory management that automatically recovers memory that has been allocated to objects that are (at least) no longer reachable. An efficient garbage collector will minimize memory fragmentation, avoid memory leaks, and improve performance.
Properties of an Efficient Garbage Collector.

Properties of an Efficient Garbage Collector.
	Automatic memory management.
	Minimize memory fragmentation.
	Optimize CPU cycles to keep overhead low.
	Incorporate adaptive strategies based on workload.
	Real-time monitoring of memory usage.

Objective of the Project

	To compare and analyse different garbage collection algorithms.
	To measure performance based on memory use and time to completion.
	To investigate the effects of garbage collection on overall system performance.
  To improve memory utilization with hybrid strategies

  Functionalities

	Process & Resource Tracking: Monitors system resources in real-time.
	Deadlock Resolution: Suggests solutions like terminating processes or reallocating resources.
	Automated Monitoring: Runs periodically via croon jobs or system daemons.
	Visualization & Logging: Displays deadlock conditions and logs them for future reference.

 Future Scope

•	AI-Based Garbage Collection – Integrate machine learning models to project memory allocator behaviour and enhance garbage collection process through intelligent prediction of memory requirements
•	Adaptive GC For Realtime Applications – Develop adaptive garbage collection for heterogeneous workloads that adjusts behaviour based on memory pressure, usage, and performance. 
•	Cloud Garbage Collection Techniques – Extending garbage collection designs to cloud computing environments to allow for better load distribution while minimizing latency through garbage collection process.
•	Hybrid Models – Build on existing garbage collection methods (e.g., Generational GC, AI-based prediction) and combine them to produce the most efficient garbage collection system.
•	Low Latency Garbage Collection in Embedded Systems – Investigate improved garbage collection in real time and IoT applications to minimize footprint and processing time.
•	Collaborative Garbage Collection in Parallel Processing Architectures – Understand existing techniques to garbage collection in increasingly valid parallel and distributed processing paradigms.
•	Garbage Collection Incorporating Key Management Fog in Distributed Systems – Address system vulnerabilities such as use-after-free and data leakages by utilizing key management fog interactions with garbage collection mechanisms
